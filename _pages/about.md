I have hands-on experience developing `data-driven applications end-to-end in python` from a proof-of-concept (PoC)
stage up to maintaining and improving a user-phasing application.

See [cv](https://mlisovyi.github.io/cv/) [cv](/cv/) [cv](cv/) [cv](cv) for my work experience and
there are examples of [projects](https://mlisovyi.github.io/projects/) that I've worked on
available.
For examples of code that I have contributed or fully written, see [repositories](https://mlisovyi.github.io/repositories/).

I have a PhD in particle physics and have spent several years in academia.
There is a list of [publications](https://mlisovyi.github.io/publications/) with my personal significant
contribution.

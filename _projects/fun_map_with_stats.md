The open-source package allows to display an interactive map with a choropleth displaying some statistics as color per hectare (100x100 meter square).

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/projects/map_screenshot.jpeg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

The typical use-case would be to visualise and do plausibility checks of hectare-level data
  as well as to compare statistics between geographic areas.

For more information, see the [documentation](https://mlisovyi.github.io/map_with_stats/)
and [github repository](https://github.com/mlisovyi/map_with_stats) of the project.

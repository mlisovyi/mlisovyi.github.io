This was an internal project at the large Swiss retailer [MIGROS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migros)
with the aim to **enable fast start-up of a new project**.

The result was:

* internal [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) templates for
  python library (shared importable code) and application (a tool running in a fixed environment);
  * common project layout and used tools allow fast context switch between projects
    and knowledge transfer between people and teams;
* enforcement of best practices in the template to facilitate project development from
  from the very first steps;
* pre-configured usage of the internal CI/CD;
* set-up for documentation generation;
* fast start-up time of 5 minutes to get a functional environment to start with a new project.
